Unary and Binary Operators
The two general classes of operators are:

unary  
A unary operator operates on only one operand. A unary operator typically appears with its operand in this format:  
operator operand  

binary  
A binary operator operates on two operands. A binary operator appears with its operands in this format:  
operand1 operator operand2  

Other operators with special formats accept more than two operands. If an operator is given a null operand, the result is always null. The only operator that does not follow this rule is concatenation (||).
