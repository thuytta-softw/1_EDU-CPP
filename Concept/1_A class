If we are creating a banking program, we can give our class the following characteristics:
name: BankAccount
attributes: accountNumber, balance, dateOpened
behavior: open(), close(), deposit()

The class specifies that each object should have the defined attributes and behavior.
However, it doesn't specify what the actual data is; it only provides a definition.

Once we've written the class, we can move on to create objects that are based on that class.
Each object is called an instance of a class. The process of creating objects is called instantiation.
Each object has its own identity, data, and behavior.

The process of creating objects is called...instattion
